RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a pattern where you first retrieve relevant pieces of text from a knowledge base, then pass those pieces plus the user's question to a language model to generate an answer. This way the model can use up-to-date or private information that was not in its training data.

Django is a Python web framework. It encourages rapid development and clean design. Django REST framework adds tools for building REST APIs on top of Django, including serializers, viewsets, and browsable API pages.

Vector search uses embeddings. An embedding is a list of numbers that represents the meaning of a piece of text. Similar texts have similar embeddings. By storing document chunks as vectors and comparing the question's vector to them, we can find the most relevant chunks quickly.
